During my internship at DA Sistemas Integrados, I had the opportunity to work on accounting and fuel management applications. In addition, I participated in a migration project aimed at transferring a monolithic Visual PRO/5 application to a Nodejs-based structure with microservices architecture.

In this project, I contributed to developing all user interface screens for some modules. I leveraged technologies such as AngularJS, NodeJS, and Microsoft SQL Server. Moreover, I deployed the application with IIS on a dedicated server with Windows Server.

Furthermore, during my time at the company, I provided support for the maintenance of the Visual PRO/5 application for in-house users.
