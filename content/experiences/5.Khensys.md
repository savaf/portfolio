My skills for this role included JavaScript, Vue.js, Vuex, CSS, Sass, TFS, Zoho, and Scrum.

In this position, I participated in a large migration project to transfer a monolithic Web Form .NET application to a client-server web app made with .Net core + Vue.js. As the frontend developer, I was responsible for designing the architecture for the whole solution, ensuring the reliability and scalability of the applications. Additionally, I assisted my colleagues in staying updated with all technologies and Vue and SCSS best practices. The role required working under the Scrum methodology throughout the project.
