  "description": ["Corotos is the largest second-hand e-commerce platform in the Dominican Republic, I was responsible for designing the architecture for the migration of an e-commerce Ruby on Rails application. I helped create all the UI screens for some modules and supervised and reviewed all pull requests from team members. Additionally, I assisted colleagues to keep them updated with all technologies and Vue best practices. This project required 24/7 activity with an uptime of 99%, so all sites had to be fastened and resilient with network, data access, and intercommunication with services from another environment."],
