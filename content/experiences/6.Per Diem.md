I possess skills in various technologies including Vue.js, JavaScript, Node.js, Vuex, Knex.js, SASS, PostgreSQL, Agile Methodologies, Nuxt.js, and TypeScript.

In my role, I helped create all the UI screens for some modules and supervised and reviewed all pull requests from team members. Additionally, I assisted colleagues in keeping them updated with all technologies and Vue best practices.

Since the project requires 24/7 activity with an uptime of 99%, I ensured that all sites were fastened and resilient with network, data access, and intercommunication with services from another environment.
