During my time as a junior web developer at TwoCare, I participated in the maintenance of three applications. One of the applications was a desktop application built using Electron that retrieved information such as specs, IP, domain, and DNS from the computer where the application was installed, to facilitate help desk support.

Another application I worked on was an Angular-based dashboard used to display real-time information from an electric power production plant. I contributed to the development of this application's features and functionality.

The third application was a Vue-based web application designed for call centers to manage call flows. I participated in the development of the application's user interface and utilized Vue, Sass, and WebSockets for the front-end implementation.

Throughout my time at TwoCare, I utilized various technologies to ensure optimal application performance, including MySQL and Redis for caching, and CircleCI and Jenkins for continuous integration and delivery.
